üëãJames' personal website using Vue CLI, TailwindCSS, Firebase, and Airtable.

## Note üìì
I've made my code open source to inspire rookie programmers like myself to start learning.  I was amazed at how quickly things started to click together once I started building a project of my own.  This is the 3rd iteration of my blog.

1. Wordpress - Hated it.  Felt too bloated for a simple blog and felt VERY early 2000s.
2. Custom Vue - This was fun as I learned a lot, but it was starting to get messy and was pieced together in some weird ways (using Airtable as an CMS). But SEO was a nightmare to try to solve for.
3. Gridsome - Super basic.  SEO friendly.  All I need for now.

I built this using the basic Gridsome template.  It is a super basic UI but works well across devices and is simply a means to share my posts.

## Todo ‚úèÔ∏è
