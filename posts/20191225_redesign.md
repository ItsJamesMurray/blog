Hey crew 👋.


I hope you like the new look 💁.  I’ve rebuilt this blog from the ground up.  


Back when I started I was hosting this on Wordpress one of the many free themes.  I kept changing themes thinking that if I found the *perfect* theme I would finally be motivated to put my head down and write 📝.   That never happened. 


To be honest, I am not 💯 sure that I will stick to writing.  But I do know that I am proud of what I learned while I have been putting this together. 


A few months back I decided to start actively trying to learn to develop 👨‍💻—it has been quite the journey.  This site is what I am using to test out what I am learning.  I find a new thing I want to do, do a bit of research, and test it out.  Pretty simple.  🧠 It is working. I feel I am actually starting to grasp how everything is starting to connect together.  


Why spend all this time ⏰ on a personal blog rather than just stick with good-ole Wordpress?  One day I want to run my own startup, and while I won’t be the lead developer I feel it will be helpful to have a foundational understanding of what they are talking about. 


I’ll be posting semi-frequently about the progress on my side-projects, my billion-dollar ideas, and some light commentary on things I find interesting.  Until then, shoot me an email at james@itsjamesmurray.com or tweet me at [@ItsJamesMurray](https://www.twitter.com/itsjamesmurray) and GO CHIEFS 🏈.
