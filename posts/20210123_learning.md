## Quick Update

2020 was by no means a "fun" year.  I was one of the lucky ones.

I was able to keep my job.  My company was one of the first to order work-from-home (as of now we've been told we will be working remotely until Sept 2021 at the earliest -- that will be 1.5 years without getting my notes from my desk). 

I started a new role right as we began working remotely.  It is a more technical role than anything else I've done in the past, but still not quite as technical as I want.

I bought a condo in Chicago.  It has a yard and Tycho is happy (which means I am happy).

My girlfriend of 10 years _proposed to me_.  It feels the same, just a lot happier!


## What Else I've Been Up To

Learning.  A lot.

I redid Strumm (again, again, again). I am nearly done.  But wow have I learned a ton since I started.  An embarrassing amount.

As frustrating as it has been to redo the same project over and over again, I have gotten to "upgrade" it ever time.

I've been building a trading bot and have built my own API to control a number of smart devices in my home.  I'm an API guy now.
